Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correlation between Unemployment and Wages

Master Thesis, Imperial College London

London, UK

Oct 2021 - Jun 2022

- Applied Distance Correlation in a new field and captured additional 10% non-linear correlations.
- Implemented spatial regression with approximate profile-likelihood estimator (APLE) to solve the problem of nonzero spatial correlation.
- Iterated over confounders and concluded that the correlation arises from confounders under different time lag

### Depression Status Predicted by COVID-19 Associated Behavior Change

Group Leader, Yale University

Remote

Jun 2021 - Sep 2021

- Increased accuracy by an average of 6% after replacing selected models (Logistic Regression, Mixed Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, k-NN) by Linear SVM
- Improved sensitivity by 0.6 in k-NN and LR using Under-sampling, Lower-sampling to tackle unbalanced data.
- Identified Random Forest achieved the optimal F-score (0.787) and sensitivity (0.750) using 4-fold cross-validation

### Evaluation of Supervised Classification Models for Image Recognition

Academic, Imperial College London

London, UK

Jan 2021 - Mar 2021

- Built and optimized the Multilayer Perceptron model to prevent overtraining based on the performance on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Compared results between MLP and CNN model; Concluded that CNN model has a 20% higher accuracy at
epoch 40 and saved 7 megabytes of data
  


### Comparison of Different Word Embedding Models based on IMDb Reviews Jun 2020
